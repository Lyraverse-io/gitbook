# Tokenomics – $LYRA

Comprehensive overview of the $LYRA token economics and utility within the Lyraverse ecosystem.

## Token Fundamentals

### $LYRA Token Specifications
- **Token Symbol**: $LYRA
- **Total Supply**: 100,000,000 (100M) tokens
- **Blockchain**: Hyperliquid ($HYPE)
- **Standard**: ERC-20 compatible
- **Contract Type**: Deflationary with burn mechanism

### Core Design Principles
- **Fixed Supply**: Hard cap prevents inflation
- **Deflationary Mechanics**: Token burning reduces circulation
- **Utility-Driven**: Real value through ecosystem participation
- **Community-Aligned**: Revenue sharing rewards active users

## Economic Model

### Revenue Sharing Architecture
Lyraverse implements a sustainable economic model where marketplace fees are redistributed to create long-term value alignment:

```
Marketplace Fees (2.5% of all transactions)
├── 75% → Distributed to $LYRA stakers (active rewards)
└── 25% → Buyback & Burn (deflationary pressure)
```

### Dual Incentive System
1. **Staking Rewards**: Continuous income for long-term holders
2. **Token Burns**: Automatic scarcity creation through buybacks
3. **Positive Feedback Loop**: More activity = more rewards + more scarcity

}
```
