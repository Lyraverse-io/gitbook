# Frequently Asked Questions

Answers to the most common questions about Lyraverse.

## General Questions

### What is Lyraverse?
Lyraverse is a comprehensive NFT platform built on Hyperliquid, featuring collection creation, multi-phase minting, integrated marketplace, and DAO governance capabilities.

### What blockchain does Lyraverse use?
Lyraverse runs exclusively on **Hyperliquid**, a high-performance L1 blockchain optimized for DeFi and NFTs with low fees and fast transactions.

### What token do I need?
All transactions use **HYPE tokens**. You'll need HYPE for minting, buying, and selling NFTs.

### Are there gas fees?
Network fees are minimal on Hyperliquid (much lower than Ethereum). Platform fees are 2.5% on marketplace sales.

## Wallet & Connection

### Which wallets are supported?
- **MetaMask** (recommended)
- **Coinbase Wallet**
- **Trust Wallet**
- Any Hyperliquid-compatible wallet

### How do I connect my wallet?
1. Install a compatible wallet
2. Configure Hyperliquid network
3. Visit Lyraverse and click "Connect Wallet"
4. Approve the connection

### Wrong network error?
Switch to Hyperliquid Testnet in your wallet:

## Creating Collections

### What's the difference between simple and advanced mode?
**Simple Mode**: One public minting phase, perfect for straightforward drops
**Advanced Mode**: Multiple phases, whitelists, custom timing, and DAO integration

### Can I change collection settings after creation?
Some settings are editable (description, links), but core parameters like name, max supply, and creator address are immutable.

### What's the maximum collection size?
10,000 NFTs per collection. Consider user experience and gas costs when choosing your supply.

### How do royalties work?
Creators earn 0-25% of secondary marketplace sales. This incentivizes long-term value creation.

## Minting NFTs

### Why can't I mint?
Common reasons:
- Collection not live yet
- Insufficient HYPE balance
- Exceeded per-wallet limits
- Wrong network selected

### What's the difference between public and whitelist phases?
**Public**: Open to everyone, usually higher price
**Whitelist**: Invite-only, lower price as reward for early supporters

### Can I mint multiple NFTs at once?
Yes, up to 10 NFTs per transaction (subject to collection limits).

### What happens if mint fails?
Funds are automatically returned. Check your balance and try again.

## Marketplace

### How do I buy NFTs?
1. Browse marketplace or collection pages
2. Find an NFT you like

4. Confirm transaction in wallet

### How do I sell NFTs?
1. Go to your NFT's detail page
2. Click "List for Sale"

### What are the fees?

- **Royalties**: Creator-set percentage (0-25%)
- **Network**: Minimal Hyperliquid fees

### How long do listings take to appear?
Usually instant, but up to 30 seconds during network congestion.

## Rarity & Value

### How is rarity calculated?
Rarity percentage = (trait count ÷ total NFTs) × 100. Lower percentage = rarer trait.

### What do the rarity grades mean?
- **Legendary** (≤2%): Ultra rare
- **Epic** (≤5%): Very rare
- **Rare** (≤8%): Rare
- **Uncommon** (≤12%): Moderately rare
- **Common** (>12%): Common

### Do rare NFTs always cost more?
Not necessarily. Rarity is one factor among many (art quality, community, creator reputation, etc.).

## DAO & Governance

### What is a DAO on Lyraverse?
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization allows NFT holders to vote on collection decisions, manage treasury, and govern the project.

### How do I create a DAO?
1. Own the collection
2. Go to collection management
3. Click "Create DAO"
4. Configure voting parameters

### What can DAOs do?
