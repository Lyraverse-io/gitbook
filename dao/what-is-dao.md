# What is DAO?

Learn about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and how they work on Lyraverse.

## Understanding DAO

### What is a DAO?
A **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** is a community-led entity with no central authority. DAOs are governed by smart contracts and community voting, allowing members to collectively make decisions about the organization's direction and treasury.

### How DAOs Work on Lyraverse

Lyraverse integrates DAO functionality directly into NFT collections, allowing creators and holders to:

- **Vote on proposals** affecting the collection
- **Manage treasury funds** collectively
- **Stake NFTs** for governance rights
- **Participate in decision-making** processes

## Key DAO Components

### 1. Governance Token
- **NFT Ownership**: Your NFTs serve as governance tokens
- **Voting Power**: 1 NFT = 1 vote (equal voting rights)
- **No Token Required**: Built-in governance system

### 2. Proposal System
- **Community Proposals**: Any member can create proposals
- **Voting Period**: Typically 3-7 days for community voting
- **Quorum Requirements**: Minimum participation needed
- **Execution**: Successful proposals are automatically executed

### 3. Treasury Management
- **Community Funds**: Collective ownership of assets
- **Transparent Spending**: All transactions visible on-chain
- **Proposal-Based**: Fund allocation requires community approval

## DAO Benefits for Collections

### For Creators
- **Community Input**: Get feedback on collection direction
- **Shared Responsibility**: Community helps with decision-making
- **Long-term Engagement**: Keep holders involved beyond minting

### For Holders
- **Ownership Stake**: Real say in collection future
- **Value Alignment**: Decisions benefit all members
- **Community Building**: Connect with fellow enthusiasts

## Common DAO Use Cases

### Collection Governance
- **Future Drops**: Decide on sequel collections
- **Partnerships**: Approve collaborations
- **Brand Decisions**: Logo, merchandise, etc.

### Treasury Management
- **Marketing Funds**: Community-approved advertising
- **Giveaways**: Holder rewards and contests
- **Development**: Fund platform improvements

### Community Initiatives
- **Events**: Organize meetups and conferences

```

## Voting Mechanics

### How Voting Works
1. **Proposal Creation**: Member submits proposal with details
